                              go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have
                              some or all of the following signs and symptoms of NMS: high

                            <li>Uncontrolled body movements (tardive dyskinesia or TD). LOREM
                              IPSUM may cause movements that you cannot control in your face,
                              tongue, or other body parts. TD may not go away, even if you stop
                              taking LOREM IPSUM. TD may also start after you stop taking LOREM

                                  Extremely high blood sugar can lead to coma or death. If you
                                  have diabetes or risk factors for diabetes (such as being

                                <li>feel confused, or your breath smells fruity</li>
                                <li>increased fat levels (cholesterol and triglycerides) in your

                                <li>weight gain. You and your healthcare provider should check

                            <li>Unusual urges. Some people taking aripiprazole have had unusual
                              urges, such as gambling, binge eating or eating that you cannot
                              control (compulsive), compulsive shopping and sexual urges. If you
                              or your family members notice that you are having unusual urges or
                              behaviors, talk to your healthcare provider.

                            <li>Decreased blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension). You may feel
                              lightheaded or faint when you rise too quickly from a sitting or
                              lying position.

                            <li>Low white blood cell count. Your healthcare provider may do
                              blood tests during the first few months of treatment with LOREM
                              IPSUM.
                            </li>
                            <li>Seizures (convulsions)</li>
                            <li>Problems with control of your body temperature so that you feel
                              too warm. Do not become too hot or dehydrated during treatment
                              with LOREM IPSUM. Avoid getting over-heated or dehydrated. Do not
                              exercise too much. In hot weather, stay inside in a cool place if
                              possible. Stay out of the sun, and do not wear too much or heavy
                              clothing. Drink plenty of water.
                            </li>
                            <li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>LOREM IPSUM may make you drowsy. Do not drive, operate heavy
                            machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how LOREM
                            IPSUM affects you.</p>

                                <li>increased fat levels (cholesterol and triglycerides) in your

                              control (compulsive), compulsive shopping and sexual urges. If you

                              behaviors, talk to your healthcare provider.

                            <li>Decreased blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension). You may feel
                              lightheaded or faint when you rise too quickly from a sitting or

                              IPSUM.

                              with LOREM IPSUM. Avoid getting over-heated or dehydrated. Do not
                              exercise too much. In hot weather, stay inside in a cool place if
                              possible. Stay out of the sun, and do not wear too much or heavy
                              clothing. Drink plenty of water.
                            </li>

                          <p>LOREM IPSUM may make you drowsy. Do not drive, operate heavy
                            machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how LOREM

                          <p>The LOREM IPSUM System is intended to track if you have taken your
                            LOREM IPSUM. There may be a delay in the detection of the LOREM
                            IPSUM tablet and sometimes the detection of the tablet might not
                            happen at all. If the LOREM IPSUM APP does not indicate that you
                            have taken your medicine, do not repeat the dose. It is not known if
                            LOREM IPSUM can improve how well you take your aripiprazole (patient
                            compliance) or for changing your dose of aripiprazole. LOREM IPSUM
                            is not for use as real-time or emergency monitoring.</p>
